# Old Phone Pad Text Converter  

This project is a C# console application that converts a sequence of numeric inputs, simulating old mobile phone keypads, into text.

## How It Works  

- The program reads a numeric string (e.g., "8 88777444666*664#") that simulates an old phone keypad.
- It separates the input into segments of repeating numbers.
- It removes characters based on the '*' key, which acts as a backspace.
- It converts the segments into letters based on old mobile keypad as per your assignment.
- Finally, it outputs translated to text.
