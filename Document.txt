#Old Phone Pad Decoder#

#Overview#

This C# program simulates an old mobile phone keypad input method to convert numeric sequences into text based on traditional multi-tap text input. 
The program processes sequences of numbers (with optional special characters like * and #) and returns the corresponding text output.

#Features#

Converts numeric sequences into text according to old mobile phone keypads.

Handles special characters:

"*" removes the last entered character.

"#" indicates the end of input but does not affect output.

Accepts input as a string and processes it using regular expressions.

#How It Works#

The user provides a numeric input string (e.g., "â€œ227*#").

The program processes the input by:

Removing characters based on * (backspace function).

Segmenting consecutive identical digits.

Mapping each segment to a letter from an old mobile phone keypad.

The final decoded message is displayed in uppercase.
